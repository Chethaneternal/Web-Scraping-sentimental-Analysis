       "['\\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone.

The Pixel5 instrument does not receive incoming signals. The service provider\\'s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received. +1 and pixel kept in the same area, +1 receives incoming signals but pixel 5 doesn\\'t.\\n \\nOne of the best phone I have ever used by all prospective. Camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today\\'s phones. Bettery life great for nowüòÉ. Once I charged it last more than one 30 hrs. But if your not gamer üòÇ. And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone. No headphone is supplied in the bundle.\\n \\nGood phone... Great size...Cameras are fantastic... Great for one-handed use...Fingerprint sensor - doesn\\'t work at times...

This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better. This was my first online mobile shopping and I\\'m very badly affected...I would strongly recommend for offline purchase of Mobile phones because you have to suffer all these otherwise you need have much patience...your freedom to choose, select etc is not allowed in online shopping...so please be careful...do not get cheated...\\n \\nIt gives the feel of an iPhone, but is a pure Android classic.

Only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap (as it is already a common issue for many people).From usability in India, Jio and Airtel both are working great. Both are supporting VoWiFi and VoLTE. Only problem is Jio does not support Pixel 5 for eSIM (though they support 3, 3a, 4a), but Airtel supports it! But that\\'s a problem with Jio, not the phone itself.EDIT: Got esim working with Jio.\\n  \\nVery disappointed with the phone. I used Pixel XL ever since it was launched. The Pixel5 instrument does not receive incoming signals. The service provider\\'s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received. +1 and pixel kept in the same area, +1 receives incoming signals but pixel 5 doesn\\'t.\\n \\nOne of the best phone I have ever used by all prospective. Camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today\\'s phones. Bettery life great for nowüòÉ. Once I charged it last more than one 30 hrs. But if your not gamer üòÇ. And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone.

So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better.

Only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap (as it is already a common issue for many people).From usability in India, Jio and Airtel both are working great. Both are supporting VoWiFi and VoLTE. Only problem is Jio does not support Pixel 5 for eSIM (though they support 3, 3a, 4a), but Airtel supports it!

Camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today\\'s phones. Bettery life great for nowüòÉ. Once I charged it last more than one 30 hrs. But if your not gamer üòÇ. And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone. No headphone is supplied in the bundle.\\n \\nGood phone... Great size...Cameras are fantastic... Great for one-handed use...Fingerprint sensor - doesn\\'t work at times...

This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better. This was my first online mobile shopping and I\\'m very badly affected...I would strongly recommend for offline purchase of Mobile phones because you have to suffer all these otherwise you need have much patience...your freedom to choose, select etc is not allowed in online shopping...so please be careful...do not get cheated...\\n \\nIt gives the feel of an iPhone, but is a pure Android classic.

My model is GD1YQ (US version with sub6 and mmwave 5G). Overall it\\'s a great phone to use except warranty may not be supported in India. Only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap (as it is already a common issue for many people).From usability in India, Jio and Airtel both are working great. Both are supporting VoWiFi and VoLTE. Only problem is Jio does not support Pixel 5 for eSIM (though they support 3, 3a, 4a), but Airtel supports it! But that\\'s a problem with Jio, not the phone itself.EDIT: Got esim working with Jio.\\n  \\nVery disappointed with the phone. I used Pixel XL ever since it was launched. The Pixel5 instrument does not receive incoming signals. The service provider\\'s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received. +1 and pixel kept in the same area, +1 receives incoming signals but pixel 5 doesn\\'t.\\n \\nOne of the best phone I have ever used by all prospective. Camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today\\'s phones. Bettery life great for nowüòÉ. Once I charged it last more than one 30 hrs. But if your not gamer üòÇ. And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone. No headphone is supplied in the bundle.\\n \\nGood phone... Great size...Cameras are fantastic... Great for one-handed use...Fingerprint sensor - doesn\\'t work at times... But reliable\\n \\nPhotos are okay only, cannot compare with Samsung s seriesHandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones. This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better.

This was my first online mobile shopping and I\\'m very badly affected...I would strongly recommend for offline purchase of Mobile phones because you have to suffer all these otherwise you need have much patience...your freedom to choose, select etc is not allowed in online shopping...so please be careful...do not get cheated...\\n \\nIt gives the feel of an iPhone, but is a pure Android classic.

My model is GD1YQ (US version with sub6 and mmwave 5G). Overall it\\'s a great phone to use except warranty may not be supported in India. Only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap (as it is already a common issue for many people).From usability in India, Jio and Airtel both are working great. Both are supporting VoWiFi and VoLTE. Only problem is Jio does not support Pixel 5 for eSIM (though they support 3, 3a, 4a), but Airtel supports it! But that\\'s a problem with Jio, not the phone itself.EDIT: Got esim working with Jio.\\n  \\nVery disappointed with the phone. I used Pixel XL ever since it was launched. The Pixel5 instrument does not receive incoming signals. The service provider\\'s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received. +1 and pixel kept in the same area, +1 receives incoming signals but pixel 5 doesn\\'t.\\n \\nOne of the best phone I have ever used by all prospective. Camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today\\'s phones. Bettery life great for nowüòÉ. Once I charged it last more than one 30 hrs. But if your not gamer üòÇ. And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone. No headphone is supplied in the bundle.\\n \\nGood phone... Great size...Cameras are fantastic... Great for one-handed use...Fingerprint sensor - doesn\\'t work at times... But reliable\\n \\nPhotos are okay only, cannot compare with Samsung s seriesHandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones. This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours.

And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone.

So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3.

The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good.

It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone. No headphone is supplied in the bundle.\\n \\nGood phone... Great size...Cameras are fantastic... Great for one-handed use...Fingerprint sensor - doesn\\'t work at times... But reliable\\n \\nPhotos are okay only, cannot compare with Samsung s seriesHandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones. This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better. This was my first online mobile shopping and I\\'m very badly affected...I would strongly recommend for offline purchase of Mobile phones because you have to suffer all these otherwise you need have much patience...your freedom to choose, select etc is not allowed in online shopping...so please be careful...do not get cheated...\\n \\nIt gives the feel of an iPhone, but is a pure Android classic.

I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too.

I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone.

The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone.

This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better.

The service provider\\'s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received. +1 and pixel kept in the same area, +1 receives incoming signals but pixel 5 doesn\\'t.\\n \\nOne of the best phone I have ever used by all prospective. Camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today\\'s phones. Bettery life great for nowüòÉ. Once I charged it last more than one 30 hrs. But if your not gamer üòÇ. And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone. No headphone is supplied in the bundle.\\n \\nGood phone... Great size...Cameras are fantastic... Great for one-handed use...Fingerprint sensor - doesn\\'t work at times... But reliable\\n \\nPhotos are okay only, cannot compare with Samsung s seriesHandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones. This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better. This was my first online mobile shopping and I\\'m very badly affected...I would strongly recommend for offline purchase of Mobile phones because you have to suffer all these otherwise you need have much patience...your freedom to choose, select etc is not allowed in online shopping...so please be careful...do not get cheated...\\n \\nIt gives the feel of an iPhone, but is a pure Android classic.

Both are supporting VoWiFi and VoLTE. Only problem is Jio does not support Pixel 5 for eSIM (though they support 3, 3a, 4a), but Airtel supports it! But that\\'s a problem with Jio, not the phone itself.EDIT: Got esim working with Jio.\\n  \\nVery disappointed with the phone. I used Pixel XL ever since it was launched. The Pixel5 instrument does not receive incoming signals. The service provider\\'s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received. +1 and pixel kept in the same area, +1 receives incoming signals but pixel 5 doesn\\'t.\\n \\nOne of the best phone I have ever used by all prospective. Camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today\\'s phones. Bettery life great for nowüòÉ. Once I charged it last more than one 30 hrs. But if your not gamer üòÇ. And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone. No headphone is supplied in the bundle.\\n \\nGood phone... Great size...Cameras are fantastic... Great for one-handed use...Fingerprint sensor - doesn\\'t work at times... But reliable\\n \\nPhotos are okay only, cannot compare with Samsung s seriesHandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones. This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better.

My model is GD1YQ (US version with sub6 and mmwave 5G). Overall it\\'s a great phone to use except warranty may not be supported in India. Only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap (as it is already a common issue for many people).From usability in India, Jio and Airtel both are working great. Both are supporting VoWiFi and VoLTE. Only problem is Jio does not support Pixel 5 for eSIM (though they support 3, 3a, 4a), but Airtel supports it! But that\\'s a problem with Jio, not the phone itself.EDIT: Got esim working with Jio.\\n  \\nVery disappointed with the phone. I used Pixel XL ever since it was launched. The Pixel5 instrument does not receive incoming signals. The service provider\\'s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received. +1 and pixel kept in the same area, +1 receives incoming signals but pixel 5 doesn\\'t.\\n \\nOne of the best phone I have ever used by all prospective. Camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today\\'s phones. Bettery life great for nowüòÉ. Once I charged it last more than one 30 hrs. But if your not gamer üòÇ. And very thin, lightweight phone I have ever used.In simple words this is very plane,simple and sober phone for classic personality person.\\n \\nThis phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity. The phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear. I am struggling to listen to other people\\'s talk. This is a common issue of pixel 5, as I now understand. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\\'t have bought this.In this phone, the earpiece speaker is not visible, they use an \"in display\" speaker which is hidden under the glass screen. I think that is the cause of sound distortion. When I take the phone I can feel something moving inside unloose. Perhaps the under the display display is loose? I don\\'t know whether this phone has a repair service in India. This issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too. I have ordered a Bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that. However the calls are audible in my car\\'s bluetooth speaker.Other than this, this is an awesome phone, compact cute and a very good performer overall. The music and other sounds are clear and good. It is a winner in camera and all other departments. But what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for?I recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls. I shall update the results after using Bluetooth headsets.PS; Note that this phone has no 3.5mm port, you have to buy a type C to 3.5mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone. No headphone is supplied in the bundle.\\n \\nGood phone... Great size...Cameras are fantastic... Great for one-handed use...Fingerprint sensor - doesn\\'t work at times... But reliable\\n \\nPhotos are okay only, cannot compare with Samsung s seriesHandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones. This is only what I liked.Now on the negative side:-1. After a 10 mins of video call, phone was burnt like a iron rod, where I had to immediately asked to stop the call. So I guess, such usages may not be possible in this phone.2. Battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for 24 hours. So, as how you scared to use iPhones, pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind. Please plan accordingly before you think about this phone.3. Got scared about above mentioned and I have planned to return the product before it\\'s return day is due. Now Amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone (I\\'m waiting for replace, - what a hungama)Now I feel, offline purchase would have better. This was my first online mobile shopping and I\\'m very badly affected...I would strongly recommend for offline purchase of Mobile phones because you have to suffer all these otherwise you need have much patience...your freedom to choose, select etc is not allowed in online shopping...so please be careful...do not get cheated...\\n \\nIt gives the feel of an iPhone, but is a pure Android classic.

i recommend go for pixel a both are same price are different after days i returned my pixel but i missed a compact handy phone yeah but i think pixel is not value for money bought and using in india my model is gd yq us version with sub and mmwave g overall it s a great phone to use except warranty may not be supported in india only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap as it is already a common issue for many people from usability in india jio and airtel both are working great both are supporting vowifi and volte only problem is jio does not support pixel for esim though they support a a but airtel supports it but that s a problem with jio not the phone itself edit got esim working with jio very disappointed with the phone i used pixel xl ever since it was launched the pixel instrument does not receive incoming signals the service provider s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received and pixel kept in the same area receives incoming signals but pixel doesn t one of the best phone i have ever used by all prospective camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today s phones bettery life great for now once i charged it last more than one hrs but if your not gamer and very thin lightweight phone i have ever used in simple words this is very plane simple and sober phone for classic personality person this phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to

struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to use iphones pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind please plan accordingly before you think about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it s return day is due now amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone i m waiting for replace what a hungama now i feel offline purchase would have better this was my first online mobile shopping and i m very badly affected i

be supported in india only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap as it is already a common issue for many people from usability in india jio and airtel both are working great both are supporting vowifi and volte only problem is jio does not support pixel for esim though they support a a but airtel supports it but that s a problem with jio not the phone itself edit got esim working with jio very disappointed with the phone i used pixel xl ever since it was launched the pixel instrument does not receive incoming signals the service provider s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received and pixel kept in the same area receives incoming signals but pixel doesn t one of the best phone i have ever used by all prospective camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today s phones bettery life great for now once i charged it last more than one hrs but if your not gamer and very thin lightweight phone i have ever used in simple words this is very plane simple and sober phone for classic personality person this phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i

my model is gd yq us version with sub and mmwave g overall it s a great phone to use except warranty may not be supported in india only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap as it is already a common issue for many people from usability in india jio and airtel both are working great both are supporting vowifi and volte only problem is jio does not support pixel for esim though they support a a but airtel supports it but that s a problem with jio not the phone itself edit got esim working with jio very disappointed with the phone i used pixel xl ever since it was launched the pixel instrument does not receive incoming signals the service provider s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received and pixel kept in the same area receives incoming signals but pixel doesn t one of the best phone i have ever used by all prospective camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today s phones bettery life great for now once i charged it last more than one hrs but if your not gamer and very thin lightweight phone i have ever used in simple words this is very plane simple and sober phone for classic personality person this phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to use iphones pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind please plan accordingly before you think about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it

too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to use iphones pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind please plan accordingly before you think about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it s return day is due now amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the

realize invest for this phone is not great so i decided to return if anyone still want pixel i recommend go for pixel a both are same price are different after days i returned my pixel but i missed a compact handy phone yeah but i think pixel is not value for money bought and using in india my model is gd yq us version with sub and mmwave g overall it s a great phone to use except warranty may not be supported in india only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap as it is already a common issue for many people from usability in india jio and airtel both are working great both are supporting vowifi and volte only problem is jio does not support pixel for esim though they support a a but airtel supports it but that s a problem with jio not the phone itself edit got esim working with jio very disappointed with the phone i used pixel xl ever since it was launched the pixel instrument does not receive incoming signals the service provider s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received and pixel kept in the same area receives incoming signals but pixel doesn t one of the best phone i have ever used by all prospective camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today s phones bettery life great for now once i charged it last more than one hrs but if your not gamer and very thin lightweight phone i have ever used in simple words this is very plane simple and sober phone for classic personality person this phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to use iphones pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind please plan accordingly before you think about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it s return day is due now amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the

instrument does not receive incoming signals the service provider s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received and pixel kept in the same area receives incoming signals but pixel doesn t one of the best phone i have ever used by all prospective camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today s phones bettery life great for now once i charged it last more than one hrs but if your not gamer and very thin lightweight phone i have ever used in simple words this is very plane simple and sober phone for classic personality person this phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to use iphones pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind please plan accordingly before you think about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it

no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to use iphones pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind please plan accordingly before you think about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it s return day is due now amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the

i recommend go for pixel a both are same price are different after days i returned my pixel but i missed a compact handy phone yeah but i think pixel is not value for money bought and using in india my model is gd yq us version with sub and mmwave g overall it s a great phone to use except warranty may not be supported in india only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap as it is already a common issue for many people from usability in india jio and airtel both are working great both are supporting vowifi and volte only problem is jio does not support pixel for esim though they support a a but airtel supports it but that s a problem with jio not the phone itself edit got esim working with jio very disappointed with the phone i used pixel xl ever since it was launched the pixel

last more than one hrs but if your not gamer and very thin lightweight phone i have ever used in simple words this is very plane simple and sober phone for classic personality person this phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this

be supported in india only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap as it is already a common issue for many people from usability in india jio and airtel both are working great both are supporting vowifi and volte only problem is jio does not support pixel for esim though they support a a but airtel supports it but that s a problem with jio not the phone itself edit got esim working with jio very disappointed with the phone i used pixel xl ever since it was launched the pixel instrument does not receive incoming signals the service provider s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received and pixel kept in the same area receives incoming signals but pixel doesn t one of the best phone i have ever used by all prospective camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today s phones bettery life great for now once i charged it last more than one hrs but if your not gamer and very thin lightweight phone i have ever used in simple words this is very plane simple and sober phone for classic personality person this phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to use iphones pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind please plan accordingly before you think about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it s return day is due now amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the

severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where i had to immediately asked to stop the call so i guess such usages may not be possible in this phone battery is just draining even though the power saver mode is on for hours so as how you scared to use iphones pixel also brings that anxiety into your mind please plan accordingly before you think about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it s return day is due now amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone i m waiting for replace what a hungama now i feel offline

about this phone got scared about above mentioned and i have planned to return the product before it s return day is due now amazon is not allowing for direct return instead they will replace the phone initially and get another same phone i m waiting for replace what a hungama now i feel offline purchase would have better this was my first online mobile shopping and i m very badly affected i would strongly recommend for offline purchase of mobile phones because you have to suffer all these otherwise you need have much patience your freedom to choose select etc is not allowed in online shopping so please be careful do not get cheated it gives the feel of an iphone but is a pure android classic small yet powerful camera is prefect and no comments about battery life this is in comparison to the pixel that i m usingproscreen largerlouder speaker with adaptive soundone nano and one esim yet to load the esimlarger battery gbetter security featuresphone works better despite not a great networkconprocessor slowerrear camera one shade inferior despite multiple camerasselfie camera is single lens and clearly inferiordefinitely not a flagship phone essentially a downgraded pixel possibly to save money on hardware does not stay up to the customary pixel standards for camera processor speed in noticeable in photo processing after capture but otherwise ok not used enough to test battery but specs look better for pixel fans of you can wait then may be better to wait for pixel i like compact size otherwise nothing i watched alot review on youtube and then decide to purchase this phone under display speaker is not great average camera night mode is just okey i noticed much noise in night mode photos astrophotography on top level otherthing in camera is average i like portrait mode but in this phone i didn t like battery drain issue faced in my set i noticed heating issue i realize invest for this phone is not great so i decided to return if anyone still want pixel i recommend go for pixel a both are same price are different after days i returned my pixel but i missed a compact handy phone yeah but i think pixel is not value for money bought and using in india my model is gd yq us version with sub and mmwave g overall it s a great phone to use except warranty may not be supported in india only glitch is my unit came with little screen gap as it is already a common issue for many people from usability in india jio and airtel both are working great both are supporting vowifi and volte only problem is jio does not support pixel for esim though they support a a but airtel supports it but that s a problem with jio not the phone itself edit got esim working with jio very disappointed with the phone i used pixel xl ever since it was launched the pixel instrument does not receive incoming signals the service provider s message of incoming call later helps to know the calls not received and pixel kept in the same area receives incoming signals but pixel doesn t one of the best phone i have ever used by all prospective camera quality much more better then those quad cameras present in today s phones bettery life great for now once i charged it last more than one hrs but if your not gamer and very thin lightweight phone i have ever used in simple words this is very plane simple and sober phone for classic personality person this phone has a severe defect of phone calls clarity the phone call voice is too distorted and not at all clear i am struggling to listen to other people s talk this is a common issue of pixel as i now understand if i knew this earlier i wouldn t have bought this in this phone the earpiece speaker is not visible they use an in display speaker which is hidden under the glass screen i think that is the cause of sound distortion when i take the phone i can feel something moving inside unloose perhaps the under the display display is loose i don t know whether this phone has a repair service in india this issue can be a software issue too because sometimes the phone calls are not clear in the speaker phone too i have ordered a bluetooth headset and waiting to see that phone calls are clear in that however the calls are audible in my car s bluetooth speaker other than this this is an awesome phone compact cute and a very good performer overall the music and other sounds are clear and good it is a winner in camera and all other departments but what is the use if the phone fails in the calling department which is the main purpose it is made for i recommend this phone only if you do not use for phone calls i shall update the results after using bluetooth headsets ps note that this phone has no mm port you have to buy a type c to mm adaptor for connecting wired headphone no headphone is supplied in the bundle good phone great size cameras are fantastic great for one handed use fingerprint sensor doesn t work at times but reliable photos are okay only cannot compare with samsung s serieshandy mobile as the size is very small compared to other flagship smartphones this is only what i liked now on the negative side after a mins of video call phone was burnt like a iron rod where
